# Supabase Schema Cache Issue - SOLUTION

## Problem
You successfully added the `meeting_summary` column to your Supabase database using SQL:
```sql
ALTER TABLE meetings ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS meeting_summary TEXT;
```

However, you're getting this error:
```
Could not find the 'meeting_summary' column of 'meetings' in the schema cache
```

## Why This Happens
Supabase's PostgREST API uses a **schema cache** that doesn't automatically refresh when you add columns via SQL. The column exists in the database but the API doesn't know about it yet.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Reload Schema Cache (Recommended - Instant)

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard:**
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ezschiacgkrwysbfgyvc

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click "Settings" in the left sidebar
   - Click "API" under Settings

3. **Reload Schema:**
   - Scroll down to find "PostgREST Schema Cache"
   - Click the **"Reload schema"** button
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for reload to complete

4. **Refresh your application** and try again!

### Option 2: Restart PostgREST (Alternative)

If Option 1 doesn't work:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ezschiacgkrwysbfgyvc/settings/api
2. Find the "PostgREST" section
3. Click "Restart PostgREST server"
4. Wait 10-20 seconds for restart
5. Refresh your application

### Option 3: Wait (Automatic - Slow)

The schema cache automatically refreshes every few hours. If you don't need immediate access, just wait 1-2 hours and the error will disappear.

## Verification

After reloading the schema cache, you can verify it worked:

```bash
cd meeting-tracker
node verify-column.js
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ Success! Column exists
‚úÖ Insert successful
üéâ Column verification complete!
```

## Why Our Verification Script Works

The `verify-column.js` script can SELECT the column because raw SQL queries bypass the schema cache. However, the Supabase JS client library uses the REST API which depends on the cache.

That's why:
- ‚úÖ Direct SQL in Supabase dashboard works
- ‚úÖ Our verification script's SELECT works
- ‚ùå Application UPDATE/INSERT fails (uses REST API)

## After Fix

Once the schema cache is reloaded:
1. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:5176
2. Try editing a meeting and saving
3. The meeting_summary field will save successfully!
4. Check the browser console for our debug logs showing the data flow

## Debug Logs

With the latest code changes, you'll see detailed logs in the browser console:
- üíæ MeetingDetails component data
- üîµ App.jsx received data
- üì§ meetingService data being sent to Supabase
- ‚úÖ Success or ‚ùå Error from Supabase

This will help verify the meeting_summary is being included in all operations.
